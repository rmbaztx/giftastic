Week 3, homework 6 - query Giphy and display images

This project was an exercise to practice Ajax queries, specifically to the Giphy API.  

The user can click one of the prepopulated topic buttons and retrieve 10 image files from Giphy.  They can also create a new topic of their desire through the provided form, at which time a new button is created.  Finally, clicking one of the displayed images will change it from a still image to an animated image and vice versa.

Besides implementing the assigned functionality, the author tried to keep the HTML file brief and use JavaScript (specifically functions) to accomplish the implementation.
